			<h1 class="box__heading">Research Areas</h1>
			
			<div class="box__content"><p>Research focuses both on model systems and on studies directly related to understanding and treatment of human behavioral disorders and neural disease. Particular areas of strength and interest include cognitive neuroscience and imaging; neural plasticity, learning, and memory; neuronal signaling and development; and neurogenomics. The research environment is highly collegial, and there are numerous collaborations within and between these research areas and with other labs across the campus.

There are many ways of organizing the diverse and growing body of knowledge that we call neuroscience. The Research Themes listed here are representative of current trends in neuroscience, and of the integrative research programs in University of Illinois neuroscience laboratories.

        <div class="research-block box three">
          <h4>Cell Signaling and Communication</h4>
          <p>The details of neuronal interactions at the synapse, including channel and receptor functions, transmitter release and degradation, vesicle formation and recycling, and signal propagation.</p>
          <div class="opacity"></div>
        </div>
        <div class="research-block box four">
          <h4>Cognitive Neuroscience</h4>
          <p>This area combines the learning, memory, awareness and decision-making processes in the brain with the study of the neural networks and mechanisms underlying behavior.</p>
          <div class="opacity"></div>
        </div>
        <div class="research-block box five">
          <h4>Computational Neuroscience</h4>
          <p>Computational neuroscience is used to model the behavior and performance of both real and abstract systems, in order to gain greater understanding of how they are designed.</p>

          <div class="opacity"></div>
        </div>
         <div class="research-block box ten">
          <h4>Neuroethology</h4>
          <p>Neuroethology combines the study of animal behavior under natural conditions with studies of the underlying neural mechanisms. These studies relate nervous system functions directly to ecological challenges faced by animals.

         <div class="research-block box twelve">
          <h4>Neuroimmunology</h4>
          <p>Neuroimmunology is a field combining neuroscience, the study of the nervous system, and immunology, the study of the immune system. Neuroimmunologists seek to better understand the interactions of these two complex systems during development, homeostasis, and response to injuries.</p>
